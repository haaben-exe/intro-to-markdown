Follow along, little ones, for *THE* only tried-and-true method to construct the sandwich of your **DREAMS**.


## The Required Ingredients:
* **The Bread**:

    No matter which way you flip it, the bread *ALWAYS* comes first. The bread is the most consistent element of this equation. **SHAZZA SAYS** to choose the bread that you personally prefer (in terms of taste and/or diet). Whether that be white bread, wheat, multi-grain, or even sourdough: the choice is *YOURS*! 
        
    >   If you don't know which to choose and are paralyzed from overstimulation of choices, first and foremost: *LOCK IN!* 
        
    >   Now that's out the way, remember a good rule of thumb is: the more white a bread is, the more "tasty" it will be. White bread is a great choice if you don't know where to start because it's guaranteed to compliment anything you through at it!



* **The Protein**:

    Now I preface this in saying that I have nothing but **SHAZZA LOVE** for each and every single one of you out there. No matter how much I may look down on my grass-eating, tree-hugging herbivores out there: you all deserve me no matter how far y'all stray away from **SHAZZA'S LIGHT**. No matter if you're a bloodthirsty carniverous carnivore (like myself), or if you're one of the previously mentioned vegan/vegetarians out there, protein is *essential* for any sandwich due to bread being typically very heavy in carbohydrates. *Remember, the perfect sandwich not only has the perfect taste, but the perfect balance of nutrients!*
        
    >   Again, your choice of protein comes down to personal    preference. You can do any classic meat and cheese combos if your diet allows for it! 


## **Optional Ingredients**:

    For most people, the required ingredients would be more than enough! With just the right choice of bread and protein, anyone will be satisfied with the results! However for my **SHAZZALYTES** with acquired tastebuds, if you want to spice things up then these additional ingredients will do that in spades! Popular options include but not limited to:

+ Vegetables: 
    + Lettuce

    + Banana peppers
    + Avocado

## Bon App√©tit!

That's basically all it takes to build the perfect sandwich! Remember, the *perfect* sandwich is never perfect unless **YOU** think so! As long as it tastes good and is a healthy, balanced meal, then you are good to go! The best thing about sandwiches is that there are quite literally millions of combinations of options and choices out there, so you can never have it all figured out. Listen when **SHAZZA SAYS** to keep an open mind, try any of the combinations listed above, and you won't go wrong! The choice is yours <3!
